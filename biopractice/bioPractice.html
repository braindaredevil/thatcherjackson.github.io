        <h1>About Thatcher Jackson</h1>

        <p class="intro">In my first semester of college at <i>The College of Western Idaho</i>, my goal was to just get the basic classes required for an associates, out of the way. In my second semester, I wanted to try to explore the other classes available to me and hopefully discover something that I was both passionate about and able to make a career out of. Luckily, I found that within the Software Development Program here at CWI and began working towards my <em>Associate Degree in Software Development.</em></p>

        <p>For <strong>almost 2 years now</strong>, I have been working on and refining my skills in many different programming languages such as Java, CSS, HTML, and C#, to the point where I have become comfortable with each.</p>

My duties included, contacting sub-contractors about warranty items and ensuring said warranties were taken care of, creating invoices, and working on financial spreadsheets</p>
